Challenge 

**Patents offer a great opportunity for data analysis, because the data is public. PatentsView is one of USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) new initiatives**
**intended to increase the usability and value of patent data**

**Please note, that the patent data provided by the USPTO is a very large data set that might overload your computer power. Therefore, we also provide a reduced data set that is filtered to the year 2014 only with less columns, so you are able to complete the task, if your computer can’t process the large original data file.** 

**Alternative 1: The original USPTO data can be downloaded here:**
https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables

**Alternative 2: The reduced data set for the year 2014 can be downloaded here.**
https://cloud.tuhh.de/index.php/s/sGZKmdfLfdZBFK9


**Information about the data will be found here:**
Patents_DB_dictionary_bulk_downloads.xlsx 

**1) Patent Dominance: What US company / corporation has the most patents? List the 10 US companies with the most assigned/granted patents.**

**2) Recent patent activity: What US company had the most patents granted in August 2014? List the top 10 companies with the most new granted patents for August 2014.**

**3) Innovation in Tech: What is the most innovative tech sector? For the top 10 companies (worldwide) with the most patents, what are the top 5 USPTO tech main classes?**

**Answer the question with data.table or dplyr. You will need the following tables for each question:**

Question            Table
   1	     assignee,patent_assignee
   2	     assignee,patent_assignee,patent
   3	     assignee,patent_assignee,uspc

**Please note, that it is better to not upload the tables to your github repo due to their size.**
